# C++ Modules - 42 Network

This repository contains my solutions for the C++ modules (cpp00 to cpp08) as part of the 42 Network curriculum. These modules introduce various C++ concepts and help build a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and advanced C++ features.

## Overview

The C++ modules are designed to progressively teach:
- Core object-oriented programming concepts.
- Best practices in C++ coding.
- Advanced features like templates, exception handling, and more.

Each module consists of exercises and projects that focus on specific topics in C++.

## Modules Breakdown

### cpp00 - Basics of C++
- **Topics:** Basic syntax, `namespace`, `class`, `member functions`, `attributes`, and I/O streams.
- **Goal:** Understand the structure of a basic C++ program and how to create and use classes.

### cpp01 - Memory and References
- **Topics:** Pointers, references, memory allocation, and `const` keyword.
- **Goal:** Learn how to manage memory in C++ and use references effectively.

### cpp02 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism
- **Topics:** Overloading, operators, and canonical form.
- **Goal:** Implement ad-hoc polymorphism using operator overloading and master the canonical class structure.

### cpp03 - Inheritance
- **Topics:** Inheritance, `protected` access specifier, and polymorphism.
- **Goal:** Build a foundation in inheritance and understand how it enhances code reusability.

### cpp04 - Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- **Topics:** Abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism.
- **Goal:** Understand the role of abstract classes and how to define and implement interfaces in C++.

### cpp05 - Exceptions and Bureaucracy
- **Topics:** Exception handling, `try`/`catch`, and custom exception classes.
- **Goal:** Learn how to manage errors and exceptions gracefully in C++ programs.

### cpp06 - Casting
- **Topics:** Implicit and explicit type casting, `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and `const_cast`.
- **Goal:** Understand and apply the different types of C++ casts.

### cpp07 - Templates
- **Topics:** Function templates, class templates, and specialization.
- **Goal:** Master generic programming using templates.

### cpp08 - Containers
- **Topics:** Standard Template Library (STL), iterators, algorithms, and custom containers.
- **Goal:** Learn and apply STL containers and algorithms in practical scenarios.
